A Batch Connect app designed for OSC OnDemand that launches COMSOL Multiphysics
within an Owens batch job.

## Prerequisites

This app requires the following software be installed on the nodes that the
batch job is intended to run on:

- [COMSOL Multiphysics](https://www.comsol.com/) 5.1+
- [Lmod](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/research-development/tacc-projects/lmod) 6.0.1+
- [Fluxbox](http://fluxbox.org/) 1.1.1+

For VNC server support:

- [TurboVNC](http://www.turbovnc.org/) 2.1+
- [websockify](https://github.com/novnc/websockify) 0.8.0+

For hardware rendering support:

- [X server](https://www.x.org/)
- [VirtualGL](http://www.virtualgl.org/) 2.3+

## Install

Use git to clone this app and checkout the desired branch/version you want to
use:

```sh
scl enable git19 -- git clone <repo>
cd <dir>
scl enable git19 -- git checkout <tag/branch>
```

You will not need to do anything beyond this as all necessary assets are
installed. You will also not need to restart this app as it isn't a Passenger
app.

To update the app you would:

```sh
cd <dir>
scl enable git19 -- git fetch
scl enable git19 -- git checkout <tag/branch>
```

Again, you do not need to restart the app as it isn't a Passenger app.

## Template Specification

### COMSOL_MODULE

This environment variable describes the specific COMSOL version to load. This
also assumes module support through the
[Lmod](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/research-development/tacc-projects/lmod)
package manager is installed on the running compute node as well as the
requested module in `$COMSOL_MODULE`.

### ENABLE_VIS

*Optional*

If this environment variables is not set (default), then it will run the Abaqus
GUI in software rendering mode.

If this is set, then it will use [VirtualGL](http://www.virtualgl.org/) giving
the COMSOL Multiphysics GUI full 3D hardware acceleration support inside the
VNC session. Note that an `Xorg` server must be running on the compute node
with a GPU for this to be supported.
